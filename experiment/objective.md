The high level goals of the experiment are:

  1. To understand effect of changing the mean and covariance matrix on the distribution.

  2. To understand the effect of sampling on estimates of mean and covariance.

  3. To understand the implications of singularities on the distribution.

  4. To understand the generation of samples of a normal distribution with specific parameters.
