### Setting the Distribution Parameters
You can control the parameters of the mean vector and the covariance matrix using sliders.
- Mean X (μ₁): Controls the center of the distribution along the X-axis.
- Mean Y (μ₂): Controls the center along the Y-axis.
- Variance X (σ₁²): Controls the spread of the distribution along X.
- Variance Y (σ₂²): Controls the spread along Y.
- Covariance (σ₁₂): Controls the tilt or orientation of the ellipse (how X and Y move together).
-  Use the sliders and observe values updating in real-time next to the labels

### Generating and Resetting Data
- Click “Generate Data” to sample a new distribution with the current parameters.
- Click “Reset” to return all sliders and settings to default.

#### Enhancing the Visualization
- Show Principal Axes: Displays eigenvectors over the ellipse.
- Show Density Contours: Adds contour lines showing density levels.

#### Point Interaction:
Enable “Point Dragging” to interactively move sample points and see how it affects distribution.
