The pane on the right allows you to specify the mean and covariance matrices for a set of samples in 2-dimensions.

**Stage 1:**

  1. Set the default parameters and click the generate button; Observe the dataset for multiple instances of samples.

  2. Click the estimate button to compute the mean and covariance of the generated samples; Observe the mismatch between the two. Repeat the process for multiple sets of samples generated from the same distribution and observe the variations in the estimate.

**Stage 2:**

  1. Repeat the above procedure for the different values for the number of generated samples.

  2. Plot a graph between the average error, and number of samples.
  
  3. Note down your inferences regarding the graph.

**Stage 3:**

  1. Generate your own dataset by clicking on the plot area. Note that the distribution need not be similar to a normal density.
  2. Estimate the mean and covarance matrices.

  3. Note down your inferences regarding the error committed if you assume the distribution to be normal.
