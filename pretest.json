      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The mean is calculated by summing all values (5.669) and dividing by the number of values (10), which gives 0.5669.",
        "b": "This value is too high, suggesting an error in calculation or rounding.",
        "c": "This value is too low, suggesting an error in calculation or rounding.",

        "a": "Correct. The variance is calculated by finding the average of squared differences from the mean (0.5669).",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The mean vector is calculated by taking the average of each column in the data matrix X.",
        "b": "The order of elements is incorrect. The mean vector should maintain the same order as the columns in the data matrix.",

        "a": "The mean of y2 is smaller than the mean of y1",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The mean values of y1 and y2 are not the primary difference between the scatter plots.",
        "b": "The range of x values is not the main distinguishing factor between the two plots.",
        "c": "Correct. The spread (variance) of y2 values is noticeably smaller than that of y1 values, indicating less variability.",
        "d": "The relationship between variables is not the main difference being asked about.",
        "e": "The difference in variance between the two plots is observable and measurable."

      "question": "5. Suppose that within a very large corporation salaries are positively skewed with a mean of 40,000 dollars and a standard deviation of 20,000 dollars. Which statement is true for a sample of workers?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At least 68.3 percent of workers have a salary between 20,000 dollars and 60,000 dollars",
        "b": "At least 75.0 percent of workers have a salary between 20,000 dollars and 60,000 dollars",

      "correctAnswer": "e",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This would be true for a normal distribution, but the data is positively skewed, so we cannot make this assumption.",
        "b": "This would be true for a normal distribution, but the data is positively skewed, so we cannot make this assumption.",
        "c": "Without knowing the exact shape of the skewed distribution, we cannot make this claim.",
        "d": "Without knowing the exact shape of the skewed distribution, we cannot make this claim.",
        "e": "Correct. Since the distribution is positively skewed, we cannot make assumptions about the percentage of workers in any salary range without more information about the distribution."
